### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Patricio Randle
#### Full Stack Developer


After spending 20 years in different companies I've found my passion in programming.

I started when I was very young programming with D-Base in DOS, Windows wasn't born at that time!

Looking here and there I decided to once and for all jump into programming, so I entered Henry's bootcamp.

I'm experienced in leading and creating working groups. Bilingual.

If you're looking for a hardworking and enthusiastic person for your team, I'll be happy to join you.

Skills: JavaScript, ReactJS, ReduxJS, NodeJS, Express, CSS-
