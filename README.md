Hi, I'm Patricio Randle!

After spending 20 years in different companies I've found my passion in programming. 

I started when I was very young programming with D-Base in DOS, Windows wasn't born at that time!

Looking here and there I decided to once and for all jump into programmig, so I entered Henry's bootcamp.

JavaScript, NodeJS, ReactJS, ReduxJS, Sequelize, Express and Postgress have been the main technologies of the academy.

I'm experienced in leading and creating working groups. Bilingual.

If you're looking for a hardworking and enthusiastic person for your team, I'll be happy to join you.
